üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites and Setup
To run this assistant, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

1. Installation
You can install all necessary Python packages using pip:

Bash

pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition wikipedia
2. Configuration
A. Text-to-Speech:

The script uses pyttsx3 and is configured to use the SAPI5 voice engine (voices[0].id), which is common on Windows systems.

B. Speech Recognition:

The takeCommand() function uses the Google Speech Recognition API (requires an active internet connection).

C. Email Functionality (Crucial Security Note):

The sendEmail() function uses smtplib for sending mail via Gmail.

You must update the following placeholders in the sendEmail function:

'youremail@gmail.com'

'your-password' (or an App Password for enhanced security, as Google often blocks direct password login)

Highly Recommended: Use a Google App Password instead of your main account password, as using your plain password can be a security risk.

D. Hardcoded Paths:

For play music and open code commands, you must update the file paths to match your local machine:

music_dir = 'D:\\Non Critical\\songs\\Favorite Songs2'

codePath = "C:\\Users\\Haris\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe"

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Assistant
Ensure all prerequisites are installed and configured.

Run the script from your terminal:

Bash

python your_script_name.py
The assistant will greet you: "I am vishal assistant. Please tell me how may I help you"

Wait for the "Listening..." prompt, then speak your command (e.g., "open youtube" or "tell me the time").

The assistant will execute the task and confirm with an audible response.
